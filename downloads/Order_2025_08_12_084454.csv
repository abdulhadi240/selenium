My extended team can even help execute this roadmap.\n\nMy results speak for themselves:\n\n👉Simplified Tia Healthcare's value prop, helping them from $20MM to secure a $100MM VC raise.\n👉Generated 2X EBITDA growth for The Upside, a business consultant community.\n👉Developed a global B2B mobile security campaign for Samsung, achieving a 5pt awareness lift and 40x web traffic increase\n👉Created $15M+ brand partnerships for Coca-Cola and Nike, boosting sales.\n👉Awarded Gold Lions at Cannes and recognized by the UN Global Opportunity Lab\n\nOn a personal note, my passion ignited by my two sons, is to fight for education equality for the neurodiverse.

This measure reflects both access and outcomes, representing the likelihood that a student at CCNY can move up two or more income quintiles. In addition, the Center for World University Rankings places CCNY in the top 1.2% of universities worldwide in terms of academic excellence. More than 15,000 students pursue undergraduate and graduate degrees in eight professional schools and divisions, driven by significant funded research, creativity and scholarship. \n\nCCNY is as diverse, dynamic and visionary as New York City itself. Outstanding programs in architecture, engineering, education and the liberal arts and sciences prepare our students for the future, and produce outstanding leaders in every field. Whether they are drawn to the traditional, like philosophy or sociology, or emerging fields like sonic arts or biomedical engineering, our baccalaureate graduates go on to graduate programs at Stanford, Columbia or MIT – or they stay right here in one of our 50 master's programs or our doctoral programs in engineering, the laboratory sciences, and psychology. \n\nNowhere else in the city do undergraduates have so many opportunities to conduct research with professors and publish and present their findings. In our science, engineering and social science programs, more than 300 undergrads work alongside senior researchers in funded projects. Leading CUNY in funded research, we house a number of research centers. Nearly all of our full-time faculty hold PhDs or—like our architecture faculty—maintain professional practices.

This measure reflects both access and outcomes, representing the likelihood that a student at CCNY can move up two or more income quintiles. In addition, the Center for World University Rankings places CCNY in the top 1.2% of universities worldwide in terms of academic excellence. More than 15,000 students pursue undergraduate and graduate degrees in eight professional schools and divisions, driven by significant funded research, creativity and scholarship. \n\nCCNY is as diverse, dynamic and visionary as New York City itself. Outstanding programs in architecture, engineering, education and the liberal arts and sciences prepare our students for the future, and produce outstanding leaders in every field. Whether they are drawn to the traditional, like philosophy or sociology, or emerging fields like sonic arts or biomedical engineering, our baccalaureate graduates go on to graduate programs at Stanford, Columbia or MIT – or they stay right here in one of our 50 master's programs or our doctoral programs in engineering, the laboratory sciences, and psychology. \n\nNowhere else in the city do undergraduates have so many opportunities to conduct research with professors and publish and present their findings. In our science, engineering and social science programs, more than 300 undergrads work alongside senior researchers in funded projects.
